# Decompiling for Fun and Profit

This exercise is about exploring what decompiled .NET binaries look
like and how to leverage that to better understand what potential risky
programs in your environment are doing.

In this exercise folder, you'll find another folder called `Obfuscated`
which contains 6 binaries. Five of the binaries are obfuscated with various
techniques and one, `main.exe`, is the original binary.

Your goal will be to explore what different obfuscation techniques look like
in a .NET decompiler. We'll be using dnSpy which is available in the Tools directory
of the 2019 content (wwhf/2019/Tools/dnSpy-net472.zip).

If Zac doesn't go over how to use the decompiler, bug him to do so.

# As always, ask questions.
